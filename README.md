## 📖 Story Behind
While traveling, I often struggled to find nearby masjids and their **exact prayer timings**.  
Google Maps shows masjids, but **timings are missing or outdated**.  
That’s why I built **Masjid Finder** — a platform where people can **easily find masjids and contribute timings** to help others pray with jamaat.
